# SI7021
The Si7021 I2C Humidity and Temperature Sensor is a monolithic CMOS IC integrating:

humidity and temperature sensor elements,
an analog-to-digital converter,
signal processing,
calibration data, and
an I2C Interface.
The Si7021 offers an accurate, low-power, factory-calibrated digital solution ideal for measuring humidity, dew-point, and temperature, in a number of industrial and consumer applications.

Applications of Si7021 include:
- respiratory therapy.
- defogging.
- mobile phones and tablets.
- white goods.
- indoor weather stations.
- asset/goods tracking.
- automotive climate controls. 
- micro-environments/data center monitoring.
