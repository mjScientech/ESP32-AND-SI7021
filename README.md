# SI7021
The Si7021 I2C Humidity and Temperature Sensor is a monolithic CMOS IC integrating:

humidity and temperature sensor elements,
an analog-to-digital converter,
signal processing,
calibration data, and
an I2C Interface.
The Si7021 offers an accurate, low-power, factory-calibrated digital solution ideal for measuring humidity, dew-point, and temperature, in a number of industrial and consumer applications.

Applications of Si7021 include:
(1)respiratory therapy.
(2)defogging.
(3)mobile phones and tablets.
(4)white goods.
(5)indoor weather stations.
(6)asset/goods tracking.
(7)automotive climate controls. 
(8)micro-environments/data center monitoring.
